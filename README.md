My Suggestions for Development esty
脥�Augmented Reality (AR) Shopping Experience: Allowing users to visualize items (e.g., jewelry or home décor) through AR would
improve product engagement.
脥�Expanded Payment Methods: Introducing cryptocurrency payments or direct international payment methods could cater to a
broader audience.
脥�Better Seller Analytics: Giving sellers more data insights on customer trends could help improve their sales strategies.
Disadvantages:
 Limited Product Availability: Handmade items take time to produce, leading to potential stock shortages.
 Higher Prices Compared to Mass Market Retailers: Etsy’s handcrafted goods are pricier, which may deter budget-conscious
shoppers.
 Shipping Delays: Since most sellers operate independently, shipping timelines can vary widely and may cause frustration.
My Suggestions for Development for Amazon
脥�Sustainability-Focused Shopping: A dedicated eco-friendly section with verified sustainable products could appeal to conscious
consumers.
脥�Improved Return Policy Transparency: Simplifying return explanations and reducing unnecessary conditions would enhance user
trust.
脥�Voice-Activated Shopping Optimization: Making Alexa’s shopping suggestions more intuitive and contextual would improve AIassisted purchases.
Disadvantages:
 Marketplace Quality Control: Since third-party sellers dominate Amazon, product authenticity and quality are sometimes
compromised.
 Overwhelming Choices: With so many similar products listed, decision fatigue can be an issue for shoppers.
 Data Privacy Concerns: Amazon collects extensive user data, raising concerns about privacy and targeted advertising
